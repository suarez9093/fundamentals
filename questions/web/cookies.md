# What are cookies?

- A cookie is nothing but a small text file that's stored in your browser and contains some data:

1. A name-value pair containing the actual data
2. An expiry date after which it is no longer valid
3. The domain and path of the server it should be sent to

## Why?

Servers are stateless meaning they cannot remember if a user has requested a page before.
