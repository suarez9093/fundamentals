# How does the internet work?

1. You make a request on your browser for a website
2. Your browser then goes to your modem.
3. Your modem then goes to the ISP (internet service provider)
4. Your ISP checks a DNS (domain name server). Essenially the phone book of the internet.
5. The domain name gives the IP address (internet protocol)
