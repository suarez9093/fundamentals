# State and Lifecycle

1. What is the difference between props and state? - They are both objects but props are properties you pass down to components and state is the data that is managed within the component.

2. What is the difference between state in a class component versus state in a function component? Class - something that persists, state in a function component is something that is recalled

3. What is the component lifecycle? Mounting(render, componentDidMount), updating(render, componentDidUpdate), unmounting(componentWillUnmount)
