# What is scope?

- Scope determines the accessibility of variables, objects, and functions from different parts of the code. In JavaScript, objects and functions are also variables.

## Two types of scope.

1. Global Scope
2. Local Scope

### Notes

1. JavaScript has function scope: Each function creates a new scope.
2. Scope determines the accessibility (visibility) of these variables.
3. Variables defined inside a function are not accessible (visible) from outside the function.
