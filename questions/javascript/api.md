## REST API

- When it comes to getting a specific type of data that is outside our applcation we often will use a special API called REST API.
- To get data we use JS to make a network request (ajax request)
- Different HTTP methods that we use to tell the api what we want to do with the data are GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE
