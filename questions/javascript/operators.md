# What are the different types of operators?

1. Binary
2. Unary
3. Ternary

### Binary

- Arithmitic binary operators:
  - +, -, \*, /, %

"=" is the assignment operator. It assigns a value to something.
<br />
"== and === " are relational operators.

== checks if something is equal to something else but does not check the data type. Ex. "2" == 2 ? => true
=== checks if something is eqal to something as well but checks the data type. "2" === 2 ? => false. String two does not equal 2.
