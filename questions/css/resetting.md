# Resetting VS Normalizing in CSS

## Why use it? We want to normalize the way our HTML look in each browser. Each browser applies their own styling to html elements.

- Resetting: Resets all of the browsers stylings. More aggressive solution
- Normalizing: Is a css file that provides cross-browser consistency in the default styling of HTML. Since IE and edge do not have selectors normalize takes IE and edge styles and applies them to all browsers. Gentle solution
