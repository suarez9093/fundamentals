# What is the DOM - The Document Object Model

When an HTML document is loaded into the browser it becomes the document object. It is the root node of the HTML document and is constructed as a tree of objects.

- JavaScript has access to the global object called window. On the window object is a property called document. The document property is what is referred to as the DOM.

```HTML
<!-- The classic way to visualize the DOM is as a tree -->
<!-- Each element in the tree is called a node -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title></title>
    </head>
    <body></body>
</html>

```
