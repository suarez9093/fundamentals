# Numbers


If you needing to express an exponent, you can use `e`.

```javascript
const number = 2.998e8; // Which is the same as 2.998 * 10^8 = 299,800,000
```

- Special Numbers: Infinity, -Infinity, NaN

# String


# Operators
- Two types of operators:
  Urnary and binary operators. Urnary operators (typeof), binary (3 == 2). Binary looks at two values and urnary looks at one. 
Operators: +, -, *, /, %, **, ++, --, !, &&, ||, &, |, ^, <<, >>, >>>, ==, ===, !=, !==, >, >=, <, <=, ?, typeof

Note: Only one value in JS is not equal to itself: NaN

Falsy values: 0, false and "";
